# Future prediction model
This is the project for the advanced programming and machine learning classes. We have tried to create the classification model based on the questionaries implement from the LEMON/dataset (https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/MPI-Leipzig_Mind-Brain-Body-LEMON/Behavioural_Data_MPILMBB_LEMON/). 


# Hypothesis 
The topic of our project is: *"Relationship between perception of remaining time in life and other traits."*

Our research question sounds: Can model predict wether someone has open-ended vs limited time perspective based on other information like gender, usage of the alcohol, anxiety trait, stress perception, optimism-perssimism, socio-emotional support, emotional regulation?

# Variables
Our considered variables include:

**DEPENDENT**: Future Time Perspective (FTP)

**INDEPENDENT**: 
- METAfile: age, geneder, alcohol usage (AUDIT)
- anxiety trait (STAI-G-X2)
- stress perception (PSQ)
- socio-emotional support (F-SozU K-22)
